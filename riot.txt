Nerd Tracker is currently a simple app which came from an idea from a group of friends that really enjoy playing Clash on League of Legends! It was first a personal feature for us to try an check other teams's status in general, their main characters, win rate, and other statistics. But as I would make the app I felt like it could actually turn into something bigger later on so I felt like making an actually public app for it! It is currently a simple tracker app for people to check other players profile, which I plan on implementing many other features.
